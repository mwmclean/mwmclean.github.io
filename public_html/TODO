      heigher than it should be

     to be hidden under footer nav

* [x (seemingly)] make UTS logo anchor clickable
* [x] unclick example button should hide example and change button colour
* [x] Sydney example first row of plots: 2nd plot overlaps 1st if screen width reduced
      (fixed using img-responsive class)
